I started of my final project with the topic urban wellbeing / health knowing that I would have to narrow it down pretty quickly. During the first two weeks I jumped quickly between convergent and divergent phases in order to test out different assumptions through user or desk research. I might jumped onto things too quickly sometimes, but also I was afraid that I should be already more concrete by now.

Those two first weeks I tried to wrap my head around a more concrete topic, which I am excited about and which I could executed with the means and time given. Furthermore I arranged several more interviews which I could not conduct, because I could not find a date and time which would have worked for both sides. Particular the second week was packed with events from school.

## First Expert Interviews

>The biggest challenges I have to deal with as city planner is segregation and property speculation.

![Torkil](./torkil.jpg)
*Torkil how is working as a city planner, involved in citizen participation for the city of Copenhagen*

>City design is citizens vs citizens, it's a democratic learning process.

>Don't hold a meeting, hold a party.
><footer><cite>Torkil, 2017</cite></footer>

![Osterbro](./torkil2.jpg)
*In addition to the interview I also attended an urban planing lecture where Torkil was showing us some concrete examples of neighborhood renewal and climate change resilience projects in the city*

>Teenagers in Vienna often switch places where they hangout every few weeks, if they are mobile.
><footer><cite>Jekaterina, 2017</cite></footer>

![Jekaterina](./jekaterina.jpg)
*Jekaterina a pedagogue working in a youth centre in Vienna and I talked with her about ownership and mental health of young people in the urban space.*

>Teenagers occupy parks because there is something exciting (people, girls, police trouble) going on there.
><footer><cite>Jekaterina, 2017</cite></footer>


![Anja](./anja.jpg)
*Anja is a Lead Insight Expert / Cultural Anthropologist at Future Cities Catapult which shared a lot of her insights and techniques for doing research in the city with me.*

>Using extreme or non users for product research is a good way to identify completely new use cases.
><footer><cite>Anja, 2017</cite></footer>

Going forward with my user research knew I will have to pick a more concrete spot in Copenhagen and either research more around how people cope with factors which are influencing their mental wellbeing or pick one aspect which is influencing mental wellbeing like social networks in the urban neighborhood, stress, loneliness, segregation …

## Additional Research and Inspiration

![Nicolay](./nicolay.jpg)

*Nicolay Boyadjiev's lecture talking about the projects at [Strelka](http://strelka.com) during the Techfestival reminded and inspired me that I might have to take a bit of a different approach in integrating user research in my work if I want to design something more innovative.*

>People are very emotional when they are not involved in changes in their sourounding
><footer><cite>Karin Brandt, coUrbanize, 2016</cite></footer>

![Joao](./joao.jpg)

*During our industry project in Porto I had a inspiring talk with a Portuguese architect.*

>There is a hidden city behind the facades of Porto — talking about the islands (ihlas) in the courtyards of Porto, where the poor working class was and is living.
><footer><cite>João, 2017</cite></footer>

![Ilhas](./ilhas.jpg)

*When walking through Porto the courtyard in between all this small houses — often only 2 by 2 meter — the street felt very much like a extension of the living room. This is one example but in Portugal I had the feeling that everything is a bit more open to the street and more is happening at the street. This probably influences neighborhoods in Porto and the people living there a lot.*

![Lego House](./lego-house1.jpg)

### Online Research


[Online research link collection at are.na](https://www.are.na/share/XDZlqie)



## Field Research

Through my early research and interviews I identified two potential opportunity areas, in which I was more interested and seemed promising: **Segregation in the urban neighborhoods** and  **Co-creation of the urban space**

To have a better understanding of those areas and encounter new insights I picked to locations to investigate further and talk to people there about their neighborhood and how it is to live there.
