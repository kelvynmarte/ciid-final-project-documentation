>66% of All Humans Will Live in Cities by 2050
><footer><cite>—UN, 2014</cite></footer>

Thinking of more and more people moving to cities and the demand to have a high quality of living in increasingly dense the cities.
I started of my research with the very broad statement of intent: **understand urban metal well-being**

I am inspired by some future cities projects and very interested in the social implication of the ways we live together in the future.

Knowing that this is a very broad statement of intent to start with I knew that I will just have to look out for promising opportunity areas which spark my interest.

How can urban spaces and additions and modifications to the environment affects mental health?
What can be learned from rural areas? Or different city areas of Copenhagen?

To narrow my topic further down I want to form some assumptions through desk research, compare cities and come up with hypothesis which can lead my research. To get inspired and have a quick dive into the topic I plan to have some interviews with experts in combination with some observations and interviews in Copenhagen.

## Early Inspirations
