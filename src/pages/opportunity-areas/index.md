## Urban Segregation

Urban segregation is one of the biggest problems cities today and also Copenhagen faces, with more and more people moving to cities unfortunately this does not necessarily lead to a richer culture often it ends up in more segregated societies, even in the same building people often don't have any social connection with each other. To fight this I want to create awareness of the different people living in the city to give citizens a better understanding of their neighbors which hopefully leads to a more collaborative acting in the city.

Maybe this is not so much a direct need for the people as more for the city since we are seeing conflicts and fears arising from it.

## Updated Statement of Intent

>Investigate ways to create more empathy and connections with the people and the place citizens live in.

In particular I narrowed it down to two interesting approaches to address urban segregation:

### Playable City

>Playable city ideas are a human response to the coldness and anonymity of the urban environment. By encouraging activities that bring joy, we can create a happier, more cohesive urban future
