Instead of having spheres where people would walk into, there are virtual frames in the environment which elevate the neighbourhood. When approaching a frame a person talks about the space or a personal related story. This time the experiment took place at Superkilen, Nørrebro.</p>\\n<h3>Prototyping Questions</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>What forms encourage entering the experience? — It was not clear that you could enter spheres in the previous prototype</li>\\n<li>Is it working to frame objects in the environment with AR?</li>\\n<li>Which content could interesting?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Prototyping</h3>\\n<p>The experiment was conducted using as smartphone with a Unity app developed for the prototype using AR Kit.\\nSpacial audio connected to the frames. A further variation would be stepping into a video content once a user is close.</p>\\n<div>\\n          <div\\n            class=\\\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\\\"\\n            style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.25%;

Particular Nørrebro has a very diverse population and activities happening, so it will be particular interesting for citizens living there but also visitors to have a glimpse into other peoples activities.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem;; max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 66.56732592793281%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Sketch of Experiment 1\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment1–sketch1-1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-df60d.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment1–sketch1-1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-45144.jpg 188w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment1–sketch1-1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-2f941.jpg 375w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment1–sketch1-1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-df60d.jpg 750w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment1–sketch1-1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-b1889.jpg 1125w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment1–sketch1-1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-1d6f8.jpg 1500w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment1–sketch1-1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-a84b6.jpg 2250w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment1–sketch1-1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-34d81.jpg 3691w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<p><em>The idea is that there will be spheres added to the space by AR, when people walk closer they can have a audio peak into them.

It could be a blurry view inside the sphere.</p>\\n<footer><cite>Matt</cite></footer>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2>Experiment II</h2>\\n<h3>Idea</h3>\\n<p>This is an iteration of experiment I. Instead of having spheres where people would walk into, there are virtual frames in the environment which elevate the neighbourhood. When approaching a frame a person talks about the space or a personal related story. This time the experiment took place at Superkilen, Nørrebro.</p>\\n<h3>Prototyping Questions</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>What forms encourage entering the experience? — It was not clear that you could enter spheres in the previous prototype</li>\\n<li>Is it working to frame objects in the environment with AR?</li>\\n<li>Which content could interesting?</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h3>Prototyping</h3>\\n<p>The experiment was conducted using as smartphone with a Unity app developed for the prototype using AR Kit.\\nSpacial audio connected to the frames. A further variation would be stepping into a video content once a user is close.</p>\\n<div>\\n          <div\\n            class=\\\"gatsby-resp-iframe-wrapper\\\"\\n            style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; height: 0; overflow: hidden;margin-bottom: 1.0725rem\\\"\\n          >\\n            <iframe src=\\\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/MjX_xyS_-FE?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" gesture=\\\"media\\\" allowfullscreen style=\\\"\\n            position: absolute;\\n            top: 0;\\n            left: 0;\\n            width: 100%;\\n            height: 100%;\\n          \\\"></iframe>\\n          </div>\\n          </div>\\n<p><em>Prototyping AR interactions with AR frames and movie.</em></p>\\n<h3>Test</h3>\\n<p>This prototype I tested at Superkilen, black square.</p>\\n<p>\\n  <span\\n    class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\\\"\\n    style=\\\"position: relative; display: block; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem;; max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\\\"\\n  >\\n    <span\\n      class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\\\"\\n      style=\\\"padding-bottom: 56.11702127659575%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\\\"\\n    >\\n      <img\\n        class=\\\"gatsby-resp-image-image\\\"\\n        style=\\\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\\\"\\n        alt=\\\"Experiment 2\\\"\\n        title=\\\"\\\"\\n        src=\\\"/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment2-photo1-be065ac9b5b73785a327d029d3d7b4d9-df60d.jpg\\\"\\n        srcset=\\\"/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment2-photo1-be065ac9b5b73785a327d029d3d7b4d9-45144.jpg 188w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment2-photo1-be065ac9b5b73785a327d029d3d7b4d9-2f941.jpg 375w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment2-photo1-be065ac9b5b73785a327d029d3d7b4d9-df60d.jpg 750w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment2-photo1-be065ac9b5b73785a327d029d3d7b4d9-b1889.jpg 1125w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment2-photo1-be065ac9b5b73785a327d029d3d7b4d9-1d6f8.jpg 1500w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment2-photo1-be065ac9b5b73785a327d029d3d7b4d9-a84b6.jpg 2250w,\\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/experiment2-photo1-be065ac9b5b73785a327d029d3d7b4d9-aadf8.jpg 6016w\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\\\"\\n      />\\n    </span>\\n  </span>\\n  </p>\\n<h3>Learnings</h3>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Content is key, as with any exhibition its key that content is matching the form of presentation.</li>\\n<li>There could possibly be a link between frames or a coding, which enable a spacial storytelling.</li>\\n<li>Stepping into the movie people still hold the phone up and it can be confusing that there is no AR interaction possible anymore with the movie e.g. 360° movie …</li>\\n<li>On larger spaces tracking with ARKit becomes increasingly inaccurate</li>\\n</ul>\",\"frontmatter\":{\"layout\":\"post\",\"title\":\"Prototyping\",\"path\":\"/prototyping/\",\"categories\":[\"Typography\",\"TESTS\"],\"date\":\"2016/03/01\"}}},\"pathContext\":{\"path\":\"/prototyping/\"}}\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./~/json-loader!./.cache/json/prototyping.json\n// module id = 398\n// module chunks = 97885797418427"],"sourceRoot":""}
