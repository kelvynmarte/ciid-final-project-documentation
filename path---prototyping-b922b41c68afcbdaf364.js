People in the community certainly got closer together. We protest silently against the violence happening with cake and donuts.</p>\n<footer><cite>Marie, 2017</cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a hidden city behind the facades of Porto — talking about the islands (ihlas) in the courtyards of Porto, where the poor working class was and is living.</p>\n<footer><cite>João, 2017</cite></footer>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>Idea</h3>\n<p>This prototype is an exhibition in the urban space, where <em>visitors</em> of the exhibition could experience the rich diverse events, but also just daily activities of other people living in the same neighbourhood. The idea is inspired by the recent events happening in Nørrebro as response to the shooting, where people show their support for the neighbourhood and more communal activities are happening now than before. One of the efforts made is also to fight the perception that the area is a dangerous place. Particular Nørrebro has a very diverse population and activities happening, so it will be particular interesting for citizens living there but also visitors to have a glimpse into other peoples activities.</p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class="gatsby-resp-image-wrapper"\n    style="position: relative; display: block; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem;; max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"\n  >\n    <span\n      class="gatsby-resp-image-background-image"\n      style="padding-bottom: 66.56732592793281%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(\'data:image/jpeg;base64,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\'); background-size: cover; display: block;"\n    >\n      <img\n        class="gatsby-resp-image-image"\n        style="width: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;"\n        alt="Sketch of Experiment 1"\n        title=""\n        src="/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-df60d.jpg"\n        srcset="/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-45144.jpg 188w,\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-2f941.jpg 375w,\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-df60d.jpg 750w,\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-b1889.jpg 1125w,\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-1d6f8.jpg 1500w,\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-a84b6.jpg 2250w,\n/ciid-final-project-documentation/static/1a5820c4539c9a1b8a9a490fc9278bda-34d81.jpg 3691w"\n        sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<p><em>The idea is that there will be spheres added to the space by AR, when people walk closer they can have a audio peak into them.

Instead of having spheres where people would walk into, there are virtual frames in the environment which elevate the neighbourhood.
